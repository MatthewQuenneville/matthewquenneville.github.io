Much of the research that I have done during my PhD has been focused on measuring the shape of galaxies. In order to do this, we need to understand how stars move within galaxies of a given shape. For galaxies that aren't higly symmetric, it isn't possible to solve for orbit trajectories. Stackel potentials are a class of models which are triaxial (ie. not rotationally symmetric about any axis), but with relatively simple orbital dynamics. Stackel potentials are useful since they give us an idea of the types of orbits that will exist in other more realistic galaxy models.

The orbits within a Stackel potential belong to four distinct families.

### Short-axis Tube Orbits

The first orbit family are the short-axis tube orbits. These orbits rotate about the short-axis of the triaxial shape, and carry a net angular momentum along that axis. Each short-axis tube orbit has a corresponding "retrograde" orbit that has the opposite rotation direction. Short-axis tube orbits are the dominant type of orbit in oblate axisymmetric galaxies.

### Inner and Outer Long-axis Tube Orbits

These two orbit families both rotate about the long-axis of the triaxial shape and carry a net angular momentum about that axis. Like the short-axis tube orbits, each long-axis tube orbit has a corresponding retrograde orbit that has the opposite rotation direction. The inner and outer long-axis tubes differ in their shapes, with the inner long-axis tubes getting narrower in the center and the outer long-axis tubes getting wider. These two orbit families are the dominant orbit types in prolate axisymmetric galaxies.

### Box Orbits

The final orbit family are the box orbits. These orbits have no sense of rotation: instead they oscillate in each direction. These orbits are unique to triaxial galaxies. Unlike the tube orbits, box orbits will pass arbitrarily close to the center of the galaxy, given enough time. This means that they can be easily disrupted if the galaxy hosts a central supermassive black hole.
