I completed my PhD in physics at UC Berkeley, where I studied galaxies and the supermassive black holes that lie in their centers. I was particularly focused on how stars move within their galaxies, and what stellar motions can tell us about these galaxies, their shapes, and their central black holes. My PhD advisor was [Chung-Pei Ma](https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~cpma/).

I'm originally from North Vancouver, BC, Canada, and graduated with my undergraduate degree in mathematical physics from Simon Fraser University in 2016. My undergraduate honours thesis was on the relationship between the information-theoretic learning rate and energetic efficiency, and was supervised by [David Sivak](https://www.sfu.ca/physics/people/faculty/dsivak.html). I also spent time studying pulsar scintillation with [Ue-Li Pen](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~pen/wordpress/) at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics, as well as analyzing data from the ATLAS experiment with [Dugan O'Neil](https://www.sfu.ca/research/directory/dugan-oneil) and the SFU High Energy Physics Group.
