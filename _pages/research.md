I'm a data scientist and researcher who is passionate about applying machine learning and computational methods to novel, impactful questions. My PhD research at UC Berkeley was focused on learning how supermassive black holes have evolved and interacted with their host galaxies over cosmic time. In particular, I was interested in the dynamics of stars within these galaxies, what stellar motions can tell us about the distribution of mass within these galaxies, and how computational and machine learning methods can be used to improve these inferences.

### Image Processing and Galaxy Scaling Relations

By measuring the present-day properties of galaxy populations, we can make inferences about how they formed. To do this, we need accurate measurements of galaxy size and total luminosity. This requires sensitive galaxy images with a wide field-of-view, together with precise image processing. In this paper, we acquire and process such images for a volume and luminosity limited sample of nearby galaxies. We use the resulting size and luminosity measurements to model the relationship among the most luminous galaxies. We find that the properties of these galaxies exhibit distinct scaling relationships from lower mass galaxies, suggesting that these galaxies have distinct formation mechanisms.

Many real galaxies show clear deviations from axisymmetry. This suggests that triaxial modelling is needed to accurately model their behaviour. Previous studies have shown that some black hole masses have changed drastically when triaxial models are used instead of axisymmetric models. In this paper, we identify and resolve several issues that affected previous triaxial black hole measurements. We also describe and implement a model search scheme based on a gaussian process regression surrogate model that fairly samples different regions of the triaxial shape space and requires drastically fewer models, making the search much more computationally efficient. We use these results to perform a triaxial measurement of the black hole in the center of NGC 1453.

### Do triaxial models work in the axisymmetric limit?

Fully triaxial modelling leads to many complexities that aren't present for axisymmetric models. Because of this, triaxial modelling codes are sometimes used to perform "nearly" axisymmetric modelling. However, some previous papers have shown significant inconsistencies by doing this. In this paper, we show how to efectively use a triaxial orbit code in the axisymmetric limit. We also show that we can accurately recover the central black hole mass in mock data.

### The central black hole in NGC 1453

NGC 1453 is a nearby massive elliptical galaxy. It rotates quickly and the rotation appears to be nearly aligned with its projected minor axis. This makes it a natural candidate for axisymmetric modelling. We performed axisymmetric modelling of NGC 1453 and found a central black hole about 3 billion times more massive than the sun! We also found that additional constraints are needed in order to make the model's kinematics realistic.
