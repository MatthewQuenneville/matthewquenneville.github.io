My PhD research was focused on learning how supermassive black holes have evolved and interacted with their host galaxies over cosmic time. In particular, I was interested in the dynamics of stars within these galaxies, what stellar motions can tell us about the distribution of mass within these galaxies, and how these stellar orbits interact with central black holes and binaries. Much of my PhD research focused on using stellar dynamical modelling to measure supermassive black hole masses in triaxial galaxies.

## Triaxial Orbit Modelling

Many real galaxies show clear deviations from axisymmetry. This suggests that triaxial modelling is needed to accurately model their behaviour. Previous studies have shown that some black hole masses have changed drastically when triaxial models are used instead of axisymmetric models. In this paper, we identify and resolve several issues that affected previous triaxial black hole measurements. We also describe and implement a model search scheme based on machine learning that fairly samples different regions of the triaxial shape space and requires drastically fewer models, making the search much more computationally efficient. We use these results to perform a triaxial measurement of the black hole in the center of NGC 1453.

## Do triaxial models work in the axisymmetric limit?

Fully triaxial modelling leads to many complexities that aren't present for axisymmetric models. Because of this, triaxial modelling codes are sometimes used to perform "nearly" axisymmetric modelling. However, some previous papers have shown significant inconsistencies by doing this. In this paper, we show how to efectively use a triaxial orbit code in the axisymmetric limit. We also show that we can accurately recover the central black hole mass in mock data.

## The central black hole in NGC 1453

NGC 1453 is a nearby massive elliptical galaxy. It rotates quickly and the rotation appears to be nearly aligned with its projected minor axis. This makes it a natural candidate for axisymmetric modelling. We performed axisymmetric modelling of NGC 1453 and found a central black hole about 3 billion times more massive than the sun! We also found that additional constraints are needed in order to make the model's kinematics realistic.
